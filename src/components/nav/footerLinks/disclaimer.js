This website in no way constitutes the provision of investment advice, which will only be provided under a written investment advisory agreement and only in states in which ECM is registered, has made the appropriate notice filings, or is exempt from notice filing requirements.

                Although ECM is an affiliate of a law firm and ECM may have an individual on its staff that is also licensed as an attorney providing legal services in a completely separate capacity, ECM is NOT a law firm or an attorney and does NOT provide legal services or legal advice. A relationship with ECM is not provided those legal and professional protections that normally exist under an attorney-client relationship such as the following: (a) privileged communication between an attorney and client; (b) the requirement for an attorney to use a client trust account for safekeeping of fees paid in advance; or (c) prohibitions preventing an attorney from having impermissible relationships with clients, representing other persons with conflicting interests, receiving referral fees from third-party vendors, or prospectively limiting liability for malpractice through a contractual provision in a client agreement. In the event that a securities regulator has initiated an enforcement proceeding claiming an individual or entity has violated the applicable law, such individual or entity will need to retain legal counsel to represent the individual or entity before the securities regulator. Although ECM may serve as an expert regarding industry practices, ECM is not a substitute for engaging appropriate legal counsel to represent such individual or entity.
